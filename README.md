#Video to Text Conversion Web App
This is a simple web application built with Flask that allows users to upload a video file and convert its audio track to text using Google's speech recognition.

Prerequisites
Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

Python (>=3.6)
Flask
SpeechRecognition
moviepy
Flask-CORS
You can install these dependencies using pip:

pip install Flask SpeechRecognition moviepy Flask-CORS
Usage
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

Run the Flask application:


python app.py
This will start the web server, and you should see output indicating that the server is running.

Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:5000 to access the application.

You will see an HTML form where you can upload a video file.

Select a video file and click the "Convert to Text" button.

The server will process the video, extract audio, and use Google's speech recognition to convert the audio to text.

The resulting text will be displayed on the web page.

Customizing Directory Paths
The code includes two directory paths for saving the uploaded video and converted audio. You can customize these paths as follows:

desktop_directory: Specify the first directory where you want to save the uploaded video file.

desktop_directory2: Specify the second directory where you want to save the uploaded video file if the first directory doesn't exist.

Please ensure that the specified directories are accessible and have write permissions.

Handling Errors
If any errors occur during the process, they will be displayed on the web page.
